Gigi Ma - College Student, Beginner Hiker

Gigi is a college student who wants to build on her interest in hiking by finding more trails and connecting with other hikers. 

### Goals 

When asked what her biggest concern is as hiking as a beginner, Gigi expressed that safety is her number one priority, especially as a beginner where she has not found a solid community to go hiking with yet. "I would like to have a feature that would allow me have my family or friends be updated on my trail itinerary and live location. I would also like to have a quick way to update my friends and family every once in a while to let them know that I am safe and okay".

### Problems and Frustrations

When asked about her frustrations and problems with current hiking resources out there, Gigi expressed that trail conditions are not updated as often, and information about trails are often scattered around different parts of the internet and hard to find. 

"I wish there was an easier way to know the current conditions of a trail, and whether the current weather would make the trail ideal for hiking. I want to be able to make decisions about my hikes much quicker. I also want to know what people think of the trail recently, and whether or not the trails I go on have been maintained recently. It is hard to do so currently as information I have about the trails I want to hike are all over the place and sometimes outdated. I want to be able to find information about trails from hikers I trust as well". 



Goals / Needs:
Wants to explore new trails safely without worrying about losing cell service.
Wants to be able to share her location with family when hiking alone.
Wants to know real-time trail conditions before driving hours to the trailhead.
Enjoys learning about landmarks and nature along the trail and sharing discoveries with friends.
Wants to keep a record of completed hikes and track progress over time.
Problems / Frustrations:
Gets frustrated when trail apps don’t work offline or have outdated maps.
Finds it stressful that family members worry when she hikes solo.
Wishes there were an easier way to see if a trail is muddy, snowy, or closed before heading out.
Thinks most hiking apps don’t do enough to make the experience engaging — just static maps and GPX files.
Interview Script & Key Insights

Q1: What is your biggest concern when planning a hike?
Sarah: “Safety is always number one for me — I want to know the trail difficulty and be sure I won’t get lost if I lose service.”
Insight: Validates offline maps + elevation/difficulty ratings as top priority.
Q2: What frustrates you about current hiking apps?
Sarah: “Half the time the trail info is outdated, or I can’t check conditions like snow or closures before I leave. I’ve driven two hours only to find the trailhead blocked.”
Insight: Strong need for real-time, crowdsourced trail condition updates.
Q3: Do you prefer hiking alone or with others?
Sarah: “Mostly alone, but I’d love an easy way to find someone at the same trail if it feels unsafe.”
Insight: Supports “Safety Buddy” and trail-matching features for social safety.
Q4: Would you use AR features like identifying mountains or constellations?
Sarah: “Absolutely! I always wonder what I’m looking at — having a fun learning feature would keep me using the app even after my hike.”
Insight: Validates AR and education features as value-adds beyond safety.
Q5: How do you currently track your hikes?
Sarah: “I just use my phone notes and photos, but it’s not very organized. I’d like to have a timeline of my hikes with photos and stats.”
Insight: Supports logging & progress-tracking features with photos, distance, elevation.
