## Product Vision Statement

**TrailBuddy empowers every hiker to explore nature safely and confidently by combining intelligent offline navigation, real-time safety features, and community-driven insights in one comprehensive outdoor companion app.**

## User Requirements

1. **As a hiker**, I want to download offline trail maps with elevation and difficulty ratings so that I can navigate safely even without cell service.

2. **As a hiker**, I want to use AR mode to point my phone and identify mountains and landmarks so that I can learn about my surroundings and share cool discoveries with friends.

3. **As a solo hiker**, I want to automatically share my location with emergency contacts so that my loved ones know where I am if something goes wrong.

4. **As a hiker**, I want to press an "I'm safe" button to ping my emergency contacts so that they know I've completed my hike successfully.

5. **As a hiker**, I want my phone to detect if I fall and send a distress signal when I regain service so that help can find me quickly in an emergency.

6. **As a hiker**, I want to quickly log my hikes with photos, distance, and elevation so that I can track my progress and remember great trails.

7. **As a hiker**, I want to earn badges for completing different hiking challenges so that I feel motivated to explore more trails and improve my skills.

8. **As a hiker**, I want to share mini trail reports with the community so that other hikers can benefit from my experience and trail conditions.

9. **As a solo hiker**, I want to match with nearby hikers by trail, pace, or skill level so that I can find hiking companions for safety and social connection.

10. **As a hiker**, I want to mark recent wildlife sightings (bears, birds, wildflowers) so that other hikers know what to look for on the same trail.

11. **As a hiker**, I want to see real-time trail conditions (muddy, snow, closures) updated by other users so that I can plan accordingly and avoid dangerous situations.

12. **As a night hiker**, I want to use AR mode to identify constellations so that I can learn about astronomy while enjoying the night sky.

13. **As a hiker**, I want to see water sources marked on trail maps so that I can plan my hydration and know where to refill my bottles.

14. **As a safety-conscious hiker**, I want to flip on "safety buddy" mode to notify others hiking the same trail so that we can look out for each other without hiking together.
